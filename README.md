## ShilpoSphere

India—especially Bengal—is a land of artists
Today’s generation—people like us—have access to social media. We click, we post, we go viral. We get likes, we get recognition.

But what about the countless rural artisans of Bengal?
What about the housewives who create magic with clay, or the grandfather carving wood dolls in silence?

- ❌ They don’t know how to post. They can’t write captions.
- ❌ They don’t know hashtags. Most don’t even know how to type
- ❌ Their art often goes unseen and uncredited
